PIDINST White Paper - single document version
=============================================

The `Persistent Identification of Instruments WG (PIDINST)
<pidinst_>`_ maintains a `PIDINST White Paper <white-paper-github_>`_
providing recommendations for the use of instrument PIDs.  See the
`HTML version of this document <white-paper-rtd_>`_ generated with
`Sphinx <sphinx_>`_ at Read the Docs.

While in principle, Sphinx is capable to build a single document PDF
version from the sources, the outcome is not quite satisfactory due to
some specifics in our document structure which thoroughly confuse
Sphinx.  The easiest fix is to apply some manual tweaking to the LaTeX
sources generated by Sphinx.  The present repository thus maintains
the LaTeX sources of a modified single document version of the White
Paper.

The actual content is organized in branches, each starting with an
import of the autogenerated LaTeX sources from Sphinx for a given
version of the White Paper.
